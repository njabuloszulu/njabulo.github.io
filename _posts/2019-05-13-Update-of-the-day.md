## Update of the day
so today it was my first day I used a time table to do my daily duties, and it is such a great idea.
for starters, we were supposed to hold a stand-up but we didn't manage since most of us are still struggling to wake up early,
then followed by the Daily bot which is a bot I have to chat to in order to reflect on what I was doing on the previous day, and what I am planning  to on the current day.
and that was just the beginning because of a couple of things that I have to do during the like code wars katas,freeCodeCamp, presentation and posting a blog at the end of the day.
but overall I can't complain because it is work to for me to improve and use this skill that I am learning for my good.

## Cohesion and Coupling

Coupling is the measurement level of interdependence between the modules.
And Cohesion is a measurement level to which the elements of the module are functionally related.It is the level to which all elements directd towards perfoming a single task are contained in the component.We can say cohesion acts as an internal glue that keeps the module together.

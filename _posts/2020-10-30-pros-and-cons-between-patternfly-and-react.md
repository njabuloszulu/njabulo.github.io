Patternfly
#Pros
-It has different types of data metric components like pie charts, bar graphs and etc.
-It reduces the time spent writing CSS so we can focus more on the functionality of the App 

#Cons
-The react structure is outdated, they are still using classes
-Modifying the CSS is quite impossible because of how they declare their CSS variables
-Its is not flexible in terms of we cannot modify the style, we have to use whatever style was provided from their components, and it doesn't make thing simple when it comes to using functional components

React
#Pros
-It makes managing state both easy and hard (depending on the context of the situation).
-React makes organizing your code quite easy
It is fast and it can be used on the front end and also rendered server-side.

#Cons
-The pace of development is fast and the environment is constantly changing, and developers must regularly relearn new ways of doing things. 
- poor documentation like Redux promising to accelerate the work of a library or improve the entire React ecosystem. In the end, developers struggle with integrating these tools with ReactJS.

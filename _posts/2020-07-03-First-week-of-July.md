## First week of July

This week I was checking out ASP.NET Core, javascript, and doing some code wars kata.
I was starting my days with a 30minutes of type racer practicing my typing the main goal being the accuracy and I  would follow typing by doing some katas on code wars conceding javascript mostly I would be doing two or three kata then followed by a meeting and after the meeting, it was some C# exploration in a form of reading blog posts and following some tutorials.

## What is ASP.NET Core
ASP.NET Core is an open-source framework that supports all the three major platforms and is built by Microsoft and the community so we can build applications for these platforms also.
.NET Core is part of .NET Framework which can only run on Microsoft Windows and is also part of .NET platforms to build applications for Windows, Linux, and mac.

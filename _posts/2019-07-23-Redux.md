## Redux
what is Redux?
Redux is a store container for Javascript Apps,and it helps to write applications that act consistently
And we can also write Redux Apps with React,Angular or Vanilla Javascript.

Redux data flows:
REDUCERS:Reducers listen for actions,and when it hears a that an has been sent to it,then it updates the state.

ACTIONS:Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your Store.

THE STORE:The Store holds the Redux state and allows access and notification to it.
It is the middleman between Action and Reducer

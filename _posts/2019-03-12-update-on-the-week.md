## update of the week

This week my focus is on understanding the concerpts I have learned so far and practice them.
So I started with variables and functions then its going to be Objects and etc.
And today am busy with some fundemental stuff concerning the broswer and trying to make my HTML files appear on the broswer.
So far the is progress.and another thing a have to do is to practice my HTML and CSS skills more by just playing around with the broswer,And try to create some simple websites on the side while I continue with javascript.
All I can say just to wrap it up is I am taking things step by step,understand the concepts and put them to practice.
No need for luck if I can practice.

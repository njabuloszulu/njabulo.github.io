## The difference between smart components and dumb components

What is a smart component?
Smart component is a component that keeps track of the state and about how the app works.
It is also considered a container component because of its responsibilities since it are class based component.

What is a dumb component?
Dumb component is a component that doesnt keep state and its perpose is just to present information to the DOM without keeping tabs since the component only has render().

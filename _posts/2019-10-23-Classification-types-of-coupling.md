## Classification types of coupling

## Content coupling
It occurs when one of the modules relies on other modules internal work,it means a change in second module will lead to change the dependent module.

## Common coupling 
It is also known as global coupling,it occurs when the same global data is shared by the two modules.

## Extermal coupling 
It occurs when an externally imposed data format,communication or protocol is shared by two modules.

## Controlled coupling 
When one component's passes parameters to control the activities of the other componenet.

## Message coupling 
This type of coupling can be achieved by state deconstranction in which component's communication is performed through message passing.

## Date coupling
The modules are connected by data coupling,if only the data can be passed between them.

## Stamp coupling 
In this type of coupling data structure is used to translate information from one component to another

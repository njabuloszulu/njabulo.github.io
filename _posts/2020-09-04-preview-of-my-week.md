## preview of the week

For this week I was continuing with the react course and the javascript course, my main focus was on trying to write an app from back front by my self and and also understanding the errors I encounter.
With that I can say it helps me understand react and also not to depend on too much on google and ask for help when its needed.

## where I need to strengthen

Where I think I lack right now its when it comes to authentication and authorization which is what I need to put more time in and from then I think I can start create a full app where users can register,login and logout after that I can also start using websocket apis.

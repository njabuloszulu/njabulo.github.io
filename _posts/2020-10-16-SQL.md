## SQL

# What is SQL
SQL  is a programming language that lets users create and modify the database basically manipulate the database.

#  What I learned with SQL.
I have been doing SQL for two weeks now and I can say is not as difficult as it seems looking at it from the outside, and another thing valuable thing I learned is that depending on the database you are using the syntax will slightly change a bit when it comes to inserting or any other stuff we would like to do.
the difference comes the most when we are calling a table, for example, let's say we want to create a table.
with mssql which is a Microsoft database, we would have to write a create statement that will call our database name followed by the schema then the name of the table we are creating, and lastly the names of the columns our table will contain same with insert and truncate.

# Code example 
CREATE TABLE [Database Name].[Schema Name].[Table Name]
(   ID int IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    Column Name (varchar or int)(4) NOT NULL,
    Column Name (varchar or int)(10) NOT NULL
)

INSERT INTO [Database Name].[Schema Name].[Table Name](Column Name,Column Name) values()

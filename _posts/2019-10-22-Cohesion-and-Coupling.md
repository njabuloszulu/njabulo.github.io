## Cohesion and Coupling

## Cohesion

Cohesion is the measurement strength of a module,it measures the relationship strength between the pieces of functionality within a given module.
And the measurement leads to be high cohesion and low cohesion.

##  Coupling 

Coupling indicates how closely two modules interact or how interdendent they are.
The degree of coupling between two modules depends on the interface complexity and if the system has a low coupling it is a sign of a well structured computer system and a great design.

## Await

An await can split execution flow, allowing the caller of the await's function to resume execution before the deferred continuation of the await's function. After the await defers the continuation of its function, if this is the first await executed by the function, immediate execution also continues by returning to the function's caller a pending Promise for the completion of the await's function and resuming execution of that caller.

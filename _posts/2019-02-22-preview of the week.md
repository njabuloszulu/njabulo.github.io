## Preview of the week
this is my first week and it quite prograsive.
I started fist with freecodecamp,where I had to follow a curriculum and it was fair I reached the javascript curriculum.
But I learned a lot on HTML and CSS,and it help me a lot intems of understanding webpage layouts and styling but then I encountored a challage on some CSS about media quiry,but I am to figure it out before the beginning of the following week.
From yesterday I was doing javascript the more fun part of the week,it is more challaging and i was forced to think harder than i did before which is why i think it was the fun part of the week.
But beside that,it was a funtastic week .

## On Learning React
So, I just began learning React and it has been a lovely technology to learn and to work with.
it has been 3 weeks since I started and what I can say is that React makes creating webpages and Apps much simpler and faster to complete them,
but for now according my Knowledge so far when it comes to create Apps I am not there yet but websites I am confident that I can manage create them.
For now I can say the challenges I have is the life cycle method and when specific should they be used and how to they contribute to what I am creating.
But overall I am Liking it and it is better than using HTML,CSS and Javascript only for a project.

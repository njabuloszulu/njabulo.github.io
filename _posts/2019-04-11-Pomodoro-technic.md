## Pomodoro technic
The Pomodoro technic is a time management method used to complete tasks on time and cutting off distractions.
You simple apply the technic by setting the timer to 25 minutes,and for the rest of that 25 minutes you dont touch anything be phone calls,social media or anything that doesn't relate to what you are working on.
Then when the timer rings,you start the 5 minutes break.
And for every four Pomodoro's you take a longer break between 20 minutes or 30,but mostly 20 minute breaks.
And if you can manage to work for than 25 minutes you can change to 30 minutes but the 5 minutes break doesn't change.

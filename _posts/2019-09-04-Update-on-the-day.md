## Update on the day 

Today I was trying to add an author property to the Addbook reducer and it was a bit painful because the errors I met,
But after a while I managed to get the app working because today it was the first time I cloned from a different user and I can say it is a nice experience even though is a small thing but now I now how to clone.
To round it all up the day was a bit stressing because of the errors and exciting at the end all because of finding solutions.
